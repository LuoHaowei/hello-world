A consensus in the development literature is that differences in productivity are a large source of different living standards across countries.

* Prescott (1998)
* Hall and Jones (1999)
* Caselli (2005)
* Jones (2016)

What accounts for productivity differences across countries? Two explanations:
* frontier technologies and best practice methods are slow to diffuse to low-income countries
* misallocation: low-income countries are not as effective in allocating their factors of production to their most efficient use

Reallocation of inputs is an important component of aggregate productivity growth
* Baily, Hulten, and Campbell 1992
* Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson 2008
## Potential Sources of Misallocation
It is not our intention to survey the literature, and as a result, we inevitably neglect many important references and contributions. We instead refer the reader to available survey articles of this literature, for instance 
* Restuccia and Rogerson (2013) 
* Hopenhayn (2014)

Many articles, spanning the fields of development economics, industrial organization, labor economics, finance, international economics, and others have
documented specific sources of misallocation in particular contexts. A list of studies on misallocation in specific areas could be extremely long, but we highlight a few examples. In the development literature, 
* Banerjee and Duflo (2005) document credit market imperfections among manufacturers in India. 
* De Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff (2008) establish wedges between the marginal product of capital and borrowing rates among small producers in Sri Lanka using experimental methods. 
* Besley and Ghatak (2010) survey work on property rights and misallocation. 

In industrial organization, 
* Olley and Pakes (1996) study regulation in the US telecommunications industry and find an important role for misallocation. 
* Caballero et al. (2008) document “zombie lending” practices in Japan, a process by which banks continue to extend credit to poorly performing businesses in order to avoid writing down bad loans. 
* Heckman and Pagés (2004) summarize work on the effects of labor market regulations using microdata from Latin America and the Caribbean. 
* Guner, Ventura, and Xu (2008) document the effects of product market regulation in Japan and India. 
* Melitz and Redding (2014) summarize the literature on trade barriers and misallocation.
