# Notes of *The Life and Thought of Friedrich August von Hayek*
* Descended from Austrian nobility,  Friedrich August von Hayek was born in 1899 in Vienna, the heart of the Austro-Hungarian empire and one of the leading intellectual capitals of Europe. 
* His father: a doctor and an eminent botanist
Maternal grandfather: president of Austria's statistical commission
Two brothers: professors and physical scientists
Cousin: Ludwig Wittgenstein
* In his teens, Hayek turned to the study of human learning and behavior and for a time he considered becoming a psychiatrist.
* In June 1914, Archduke Ferdinand of Austria Hungary was assassinated. 
* After WWI, the long-standing Austro-Hungarian dynasty of the Hapsburgs was out of power. In Russia, the Romanov dynasty has been destroyed and communism was the new social order. 
* Hayek, like many young Europeans, was drawn to socialism. For him, the appeal of that lay in its attempt to solve social ills by applying scientific principles to government planning and control of the economy.
* Hayek was pulled towards the Fabian variety of socialism.
* Hayek: I never was captured by Marxist socialism. On the contrary then I encountered socialism in its marxist frightfully doctrinaire form and the Vienna socialists or marxists were more doctrinaire than most other places. It rather repelled me.
* Hayek entered the University of Vienna. It was here at the university that Hayek was first introduced to the Austrian school of economics.
*  Adam Smith's insights were extended by the Austrian school economists, beginning with the publication of Carl Menger's path breaking book *Principles of Economics*. The central point of Menger's work which was published in 1871 was that the value of any given product is determined not by the amount of labor that went into making it or about the cost of production but by the individual desires of the buyer and of the seller. Trade will only take place if it benefits both parties in an exchange and only those individuals involved in the exchange have complete knowledge of the benefits they seek. 
* The individual and subjective nature of economic information
* Hayek's insights: 
spontaneous order
the division of knowledge
the role of prices in conveying vital information
the rule of law    
*  In 1921, Hayek received his doctorate in law and two years later was granted a doctorate in political economy. It was shortly after taking his formal degree in political economy that Hayek met Ludwig von Mises for the first time. 
*  Mises was director of the austrian chamber of industry and one of the leaders of the Austrian school second generation of scholars.
* Hayek:  so I came to him with a letter of introduction by von Wieser who was my real teacher who described me as a promising economist and Mises looked at me, "promising economist? I have never seen you in my lectures." But we became very great friends afterwards.
* In *Socialism*, Mises attempted to show that in economic terms, a socialist state was technically impossible.  Mises argued that since socialism denied a system of voluntary exchanges, the relative prices that provided signals for decision making were missing. Without these signals, coordination of activities within the economy is impossible. 
* In 1924, Hayek began attending Mises's private seminars.
* Hayek: If I had come to him as a young student I would probably have just swallowed his views completely. As it was I came to him already with a degree I had finished my elementary course so I pushed him in a slightly more critical fashion and...being for ten years in close contact with a man with whom conclusions you on the whole agree but whose arguements were not always perfectly convincing too you was a great stimulus.  
* In 1927,  Hayek and Mises co-founded the Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research.
* In 1929, Hayek began his first teaching position at the University of Vienna. That year also saw the publication of his first book *Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle*. 
* In this work, Hayek included interest rates (prices of currencies). The main point of Hayek's book was that usually these information signals make possible harmonious and spontaneous overall adjustments within the economy. However, government intervention in the economy can cause faults or distorted signals which can ultimately lead to economic ruin. In a well ordered economy, prices convey knowledge, and for the economy to function properly, that knowledge must not be distorted by government intervention.
* Direct confrontation with two major trends in economic thinking: socialism and Keynesianism 
* In England, Hayek had come to the attention of Lionel Robbins who was soon to head the prestigious LSE. The LSE was looking for someone intellectually capable of taking on John Maynard Keynes at the University of Cambridge. 
* The linking of the dispersed nature of knowledge with the theory of spontaneous order lay at the core of Hayek's distrust of central planning. No central planner could gather together enough knowledge to create the same order and richness that occurs spontaneously in a free market. Hayek argued that central planning authorities don't develop that sort of planning ability and that their inevitably bureaucratic would prevent the creative and the diverse from emerging. Central control over individual economic decisions leads inevitably to control over what individuals are allowed to do and the ideas they are allowed to develop.
* Belloc: The control of the production of wealth is the control of human life itself 
* Both Hayek and Mises great accomplishment was to turn the question of socialism from a moral question to a practical question.
* Perhaps the most vocal critic of the Austrian school was Oskar Lange, a prominent polish socialist. According to Lange, Mises had provided a service to the socialists by pointing out the need for a more careful system of economic accounting which can be certainly solved.
* What Oscar Lange did for example was only to switch the elite from say kings and emperors and others benevolent despots of days past into the enlightened economists that could run and operate the economy from above.
* The kinds of information necessary for successful planning are impossible to centralize. This information consists of non-scientific, personal, particular knowledge or what Hayek called knowledge of time and place.
*  The Hayek Keynes debate took a decisive turn in 1936 with the publication of Keynes famous book *the General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money* 
* Hayek: External circumstances of environment made it necessary for me to explain to my English colleagues who firmly believed that the bad German capitalists had started a reaction against the promising socialist developments that they were wrong in their interpretations of the Hitler movement.
*  Hayek charged that the evils of national socialism were of the same variety as the errors of marxist socialism. They resulted from the negation of liberty and the dehumanization of those who did not fit the bureaucrats preconceived idea of what society should look like. 
* Fascism was not as the marxists and leftists tried to assert the result of capitalism, it was its very antithesis.  
* WWII had the effect of changing Hayek's focus of interest, from the 1940s' onward in his career, he basically moved into the area of social philosophy. 
* 1944 *The Road to Serfdom*: Even mild government intervention could ultimatly lead to a totalitarian state. 
* Ronald Coase: There was quite a bit of central planning at that time. The Labour government came in immediately after the end of the war and they wanted to introduce a form of socialism. 
* Even piecemeal planning leads to unintended consequences that require even more planning and eventually can lead to attempts at central planning and totalitarianism. Government errors would be compounded when the same planners who made them then tried to set them right, leading to even more government intervention. Ultimately the people in a society would be made to fit the bureaucrats plan rather than the other way around. 
* Even well-intentioned states would eventually claim the power to make any decision necessary for the state's well-being. And since morality would at some point be sacrificed to state effectiveness, those who found it easy to make such trade-offs would ultimately rise to the top. This further endangered liberty.
* But the enormous popular appeal of the road to serfdom masked a widely held academic disdain for its author. He had dared to disagree with the prevailing confidence of academics in socialism. 
* Hayek: It came in America just at the end of the great enthusiasm for the new deal and it was treated even by the academic community very largely as a malicious effort by a reactionary to destroy high ideals, with the result that my reputation was down to bottom even among the academics. 
* On the world stage, free-market ideas were rapidly losing ground to keynesian theories. This was in part the result of the popular perception that economic planning during the war had successfully mobilized resources and could do so in times of peace.  
* James Buchanan: Hayek felt like that the whole world was going socialist immediately after world war two and he felt like there was a desperate need to at least establish some connections between those who still held classical liberal notions. And so he got the Mont Pelerin Society organized in 1947.
* Hayek: Ideas were far more important than practical political activity. Government work corrupts. 
* In 1950, the University of Chicago offered a Hayek an appointment to the prestigious committee on social thought. That enabled him to cut back his teaching and to do research in areas other than economics. He sometimes commented that an economist who only knows economics really doesn't know very much. 
* 1960 *the Constitution of Liberty*: recast the long-standing ideas of classical liberalism in modern terms (most important since John Stuart Mill)
*  Hayek concludes *the constitution of liberty* with the words that John Stuart Mill used to preface his work *on Liberty* a century before: the grand leading principal toward which every page in this book leads is the promotion of human diversity in its richest potential. 
* According to Hayek the role of the states is to ensure freedom and human progress through the rule of law. In making this claim, he was careful to define what law is not. 
* Junning Liu: It is not the will of the rulers which is a governing the society but the metaphysical doctrines behind the law. We can't to make a law we can only discover laws.
* For Hayek, law properly understood is based on precedent, a system of trial and error in which the most effective social principals are passed down from one generation to the next. Many of society's most important laws or rules are not the products of conscious design. 
* Hayek was concerned about how democratic governments confuse law with legislation:  Legislation in the strict sense ought to be confined to general rules
while what we now call legislation are largely orders or commands issued to particular groups granting privileges to some, imposing special duties on others.
* Laws should tell individuals only what they could not do in order to prevent harm to others, laws should not tell individuals what they must do. 
* Hayek did grant that government might need to guarantee a minimum set of specific protections in areas such as health care, the environment and disaster relief, but he argued these should be privatized whenever possible.
* *Law, Legislation and Liberty* (Hayek began to suffer from a severe depression)--three fundamental insights on the preservation of a society of free individuals:
**order without commands** (spontaneous order)
**social justice** (For Hayek the term social justice was without any clear meaning and could be used simply to dress up the political bias of the user. As a standard by which to judge the economy it was at best useless and at worst harmful since it obscured the real nature of both justice and social order)
**democracy did not necessarily equate to liberty** (far more important was a constitutional order that would limit the power of government to interfere with the spontaneous order of society. To the degree that democracy holds government officials accountable for their actions, it is an essential part of a functioning political order. By itself however, democracy is not a sufficient protection for freedom.)
Hayek: It's no longer the will of the majority or the opinions of the majority I prefer to say which determines what the government does, but the government is forced to satisfy all kinds of special interests in order to build up a majority, it is a process that there is not a majority which agrees but the problem of building up a majority by satisfying particular groups.
* The stagflation which would seem to be the legacy of Keynesian economics caused many begin looking for other answers: Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan
* 1988 *the Fatal Conceit*
