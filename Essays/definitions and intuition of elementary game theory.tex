    \section*{Static Games of Complete Information}
    Complete information: each player's payoff function (the function that determines the player's payoff from the combination of actions chosen by the players) is common knowledge among all the players.

    Normal-form representation: The normal-form representation of a game specifies (1) the players in the game, (2) the strategies available to each player, and (3) the payoff received by each player for each combination of strategies that could be chosen by the players.

    Strictly dominated strategy: 

    Mixed strategy: 

    Players in a game are numbered from 1 to n. 
    
    Strategy space $S_i$: The set of strategies available to player i.

    Strategy $s_i$: $s_i \in S_i$.

    $(s_1, \cdots, s_n)$: A combination of strategies, one for each player.

    Payoff function: $u_i (s_1, \cdots, s_n)$ is the payoff to player i if the players choose the strategies $(S_1, \cdots, s_n)$.
