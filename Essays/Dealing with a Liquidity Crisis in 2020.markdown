## Liquidity Policies
### Loan term extension and debt rollover
Banks were instructed by top authorities in Beijing to extend loan terms or roll over the debts. Micro- and small-sized firms, and firms in Hubei were allowed to postpone repayment dates to June 30. Penalty interests on overdue payments were exempted, and overdue debt caused by the outbreak would not be counted as a default (to avoid any negative impact on a firm’s credit record).

The China Securities Regulatory Commission was in normal operation in these months. The restrictions were relaxed and firms can issue new bonds to repay maturing debts.

Individuals were allowed to defer the repayments of personal loans and renegotiate interest rates. The terms of entrepreneurship loans borrowed by individuals infected by the coronavirus could be extended by another year.

In March, the People’s Bank of China cut the required reserve ratio of some commercial lenders to release 550 billion yuan to the real economy. Other regulatory requirements were also loosened to provide commercial lenders more incentives to support borrowers. For example, debts overdue for more
than ninety days are no longer required to be classified as nonperforming loans.

### Share pledge term extension
Pledging of shares is one of the options that the promoters of companies use to secure loans to meet working capital requirement, personal needs and fund other ventures or acquisitions. A promoter shareholding in a company is used as collateral to avail a loan. While pledging shares, promoters retain their ownership. However, as the share price keeps fluctuating, the value of the collateral also changes. When the value of the shares pledged with a lender falls below a certain level, it triggers ‘margin call’, requiring the promoters to make up for the shortfall in the value of the collateral. 

By the end of 2019, 40.5% of publicly listed firms in China had share pledge loans, with an outstanding amount of about 2 trillion yuan. To cope with the liquidity pressure, the China Securities Regulatory Commission has allowed shareholders in Hubei to delay the repayment to security firms by 6 months; the extension period in other provinces was 3–6 months. The China Banking and Insurance Regulation Commission made similar arrangements on shares pledged to banks and trust companies.
## Financial Policies
### The special relending program
On February 7, the People’s Bank of China set up a "relending" program to provide low-interest loans to a group of shortlisted firms who are on the frontlines in the epidemic. Those firms are involved in the production, transport, and sales of epidemic-related medical supplies and daily necessities, and it is called “relending” because the central bank first lends to various commercial banks that then lend to these shortlisted firms. 300 billion yuan of funding is available.

The shortlist was mainly drawn up by the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Another ten hand-picked provincial and municipal governments were also allowed to compile their own lists.

In terms of pricing, the People’s Bank of China put a ceiling of 100 bps (100 basic points = 1%) below the prevailing one-year national LPR on the interest rates, and the Ministry of Finance subsidized 50% of the borrowing cost. 
### The increased relending and rediscount quota
The term “rediscount” refers to the process by which a central bank discounts a note that has already been discounted by a commercial bank. In other words, "rediscount" means that a central bank like the People’s Bank of China or the Federal Reserve purchases a already-discounted but not maturing note from a bank. When liquidity in the market is low, banks can raise cash by rediscounting. A rediscount is also a method for banks to obtain financing from a central bank.

In an effort to help firms resume operation, relending and rediscount quotas will be increased by 500 billion yuan. There was not a shortlist for "frontline" firms and the borrowing cost will be slightly higher than the special relending program.
### Relaxed regulations on Seasoned Equity Offering (SEOs)
A Seasoned Equity Offering (also called a Follow On Offering) refers to any issuance of shares that follows a company’s Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the stock market. The issuance, therefore, is by a company that is already public and is coming back to the market to raise more money.

In February 2020, the China Securities Regulatory Commission significantly revised the regulations and the SEO requirements for listed firms on the ChiNext
market were considerably loosened. Restrictions on private placement of SEOs (e.g., pricing, lockup periods, number of investors) were also partially lifted.
## Fiscal Policies
### Tax and fee cuts
The Ministry of Finance, the State Taxation Administration, the General Administration of Customs, the National Development and Reform Commission, and local governments set out a series of policies.
* From March to May, Value-Added-Taxes for small-scale taxpayers in Hubei were exempted, and the tax rate was cut from 3% to 1% in other regions.
* Social security paid by firms was exempted for up to 5 months for micro-, small-, and medium-sized firms, firms in Hubei, and self-employed business owners. Payments by large firms were cut by half.
* Tariffs were exempted for the import of medicines, medical supplies, and other vehicles used to fight against the outbreak.
* Road tolls were exempted; some service fees charged by ports, airports and railways were cut by 20%; and the price of electricity was cut by 5%.
### Payment period extensions
The State Taxation Administration extended February’s statutory tax filing deadline to February 28, and these deadlines could be further extended by local tax authorities. Additionally, firms were allowed to defer their social security payments by 6 months, and the due date for contributing to the “housing provident fund” was extended to June 30.

## Discussions
### The impacts on the banking sector
It seems that these policies may hurt bank profitability and in turn the stability of the entire banking sector. Banks’ operation cycles may be disturbed and additional effort for liquidity and asset management will be required. And there will be moral hazard of borrowers (e.g., the shortlisted firms in the special relending program).

Nevertheless, the value of bank assets depends on borrowers’ survivals and future earnings. Banks would find it to be in their own interest to scarify
some short-term profits to help their temporarily troubled clients survive the crisis. And the penalty interest exemptions are restricted to small firms, suggesting that the profit loss is limited. Commercial banks have recieved policy supports, the People’s Bank of China conducted a central bank bills swap of 5 billion yuan at the end of February, with which dealers in the open market could exchange perpetual bonds for more liquid central bank bills and banks could raise money with more liquidity.

### Policy effectiveness and challenges on unemployment
Tsinghua PBCSF and the CSRC's joint survey suggested an effective and timely enforcement of the aforementioned policies. What the top authorities in Beijing are doing meet needs of the market.

The statistics on the macro economy in China show that on a year-to-year basis, the industrial value-added dropped by 4.3% and 25.9% in January and February, respectively. In contrast, the unemployment rate increased by 1% from 5.2% to 6.2% in February 2020 compared to December 2019. These numbers seem to suggest that Chinese firms are largely paralyzed but have not cut their labor forces yet.

However, the joint Tsinghua PBCSF-CSRC survey shows that 60.1% firms have cash to sustain operation for three months or more. If the pandemic continues for more than three months, and if there is not enough follow-on policy support, these firms may exit and creat larger unemployment.
