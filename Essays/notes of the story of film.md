# Notes of *THE STORY OF FILM*
## Episode 01
* Spielberg在爱尔兰一处宁静的海滩上完成了诺曼底登陆的戏份，由此引出了filmmaking的定义：A lie to tell the truth，the art of making us feel that we're there with cinema as an empathy machine.
* 好莱坞名作Casablanca太过浪漫因而无法成为真正的经典。real classical movies是小津安二郎执导的《长屋绅士录》一类的日本电影。Romantic films总是节奏太快，而在《长屋绅士录》的故事中却存在着停顿。
* Visual ideas才是电影艺术的驱动力，而非票房与营销，商人难以知晓人心的奥秘和电影的璀璨。
* 1890s，电影在美国新泽西法国里昂等地起源。在美国新泽西爱迪生的工厂中悬挂着Joshua Reynolds的名言："There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking." The American George Eastman came up with the idea of film on a roll. Edison and his colleague Dickson egged each other on to find that if you spin these images in a box, the give the illusion of movement. 爱迪生在他发明的"black Maria"中拍摄短片，当时的发明家向光影的艺术踏出了第一步。
* Louis Lumière and his brother Auguste invented Lumière cameras. On the 28th of December 1895, in a building on the Boulevard Capucines in Paris, the Lumière brothers projected film.
* 在早期仅被视为工薪阶层的低级娱乐方式，电影带来的欢愉与震颤迅速地归于无聊。1898年后，电影制作者将注意力转向摄影和剪辑。
* Georges Méliès was a French illusionist and film director famous for leading many technical and narrative developments in the earliest days of cinema. Méliès was an especially prolific innovator in the use of special effects, popularizing such techniques as substitution splices, multiple exposures, time-lapse photography, dissolves, and hand-painted color. 因拍摄街车时摄影机卡住而发现了一种全新的特效技术。
* When other countries saw movies as sideshow in thses years, France took them seriously because of the Franch revolution, and because of this dream to project something to the world and to itslef. France funded filmmaking like no other country in the world.
* The first female director and the first female studio boss is Alice Guy Blaché. She made some dramatic arc films for the very first time.
* George Albert Smith was one of the first to film from the front of a train, creating a ghostly tracking shot, which became known as the phantom ride, as if a ghost is floating through the air.
* Filmmakers usually kept their camera wide, because they hadn't considered other options, or assuming that if they went close it would confuse or disrupt the audience. G.A.Smith used one of the first close-ups in 1900 in order to show more detail. The cut between wide and close seemed natural. 日后特写将使演员而非场景开始成为拍摄的主体。
* In America, Enoch J. Rector filmed a boxing match not with the standard size of film, 35 millimeter, but with a negative that was 63 millimeter wide. The broader image showed more of the action, widescreen cinema was born. It would not become commercially so until 1953.
* Via continuity cutting, the most basic of storytelling devices, cinema could show the flow of the action from one space to another. This made chase sequenses possible. The editting is equivalent of the word "then". Theatrical cinema was giving away to action cinema. 发明人Porter在20年代大萧条中落魄，于1941年去世并逐渐被人遗忘。
* The comic genius Buster Keaton shot a scene using double exposure which reminds us what a conceptual jumping editting was. 
* Parallel editting shows what is happening at the same time, it doesn't say "then", it says "meanwhile". Filmmakers have used it since 1907 to contrast events, build tension or advance 2 storylines at once.
* In the earliest movies, people seldom turned their backs to the camera. If actors turn backs to the camera, they could point the camera in the opposite direction to see what would eventually be called the reverse angle shot. Directors were putting their cameras into the action, freeing themselves to film from any angle.
* Florence Lawrence是世界上第一个通过商业炒作而变得家喻户晓的电影明星，事业一落千丈后于48岁时服药自尽。She set a pattern for stardom.
* There was less censorship in Europe. Actors could be more sexual. Hollywood learned from the famous actress Asta Nielsen's fame instead of sex, adding an element of sublime to stardom. Almost every aspect of cinema was affected by the star system, moviemakers started to show actors' faces more clearly, except that audiences were actually interested in their thoughts. The star system meant that psychology became the driving force of film, especially American ones.
* Through 1907, 8, 9 and 10, small movie theatres, places for working classes emerged, which were called nickelodeons in America.
* In the early 1910s, the best filmmaking in the world was taking place in Scandinavia. Maybe it was the northern light, how it changed, or maybe it was the sense of destiny and mortality in local literature that made Danish and Swedish movies more graceful and honest.
* By 1912,the most innovative use of film light was in the work of Benjamin Christensen. Swedish director Victor Sjostrom was just as great an early director, and was more influential than Christensen. They were seduced by what would be in the years to come, and they sailed to Hollywood as movie star Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman did. As a result, Scandinavia wouldn't be central again until the 1950s.
* Youth and glamour came out of its test tubes in Hollywood. No one was supposed to be plain here or sad or old or racially equal or sexually different. What denial. What eugenics. It became a bauble this place: shiny, perfect, brittle, something you could see yourself in. Hollywood is a fantasy name because holly won't grow here. Movie people came here because on the East Coast, New Jersey and New York, the film process had been patented, copyrighted.
* For years, film running through viewing machines had sanpped because of the tension in the spool. Then Latham brothers and people around Thomas Edison had the brain wave of creating a simple loop, which created a bit of slack, which would allow the machine to stop, project an image, then move on again without tearing the film. You had to pay to use the so called Latham loop or other discoveries. But California was very far away from those rights owners.
* The first feature length movie ever made was filmed in Australia. 7 years later, Cecil B. Demille shot the first Hollywood feature in the first studio built on South Spring Street.
* Filmmakers in these years were discovering that to make it look like people in different shots were looking at each other, or that armies were marching towards each other, the camera had to stay on the same side of an invisible 180 degree line, drawn between the two people looking at or talking to each other.
* Hollywood was built by women, immigrants and Jews, people who would not be accepted in any other profession at the time. So Hollywood became this magnet for people who wanted to work, who were incredibly creative, but wouldn't be accepted in other professions. Lois Weber used remarkable sideways POV shot, split screen, inventive shot of the wing mirror. But her film was credited to a male director, D.W.Griffith, for years. Frances Marion was the highest paid screenwritter from 1915 to 1935. She also is the only woman ever to win 2 Oscars for writing. These facts put the lie to the idea that women writers were writing the "matinee weepies" or the "women's films". Women like Frances were the crème de la crème of the writers.
* *The Wind* was an epic tone poem, cut like a thriller but filmed like a dream. Hollywood films like it showed female audience things they'd probably felt but never seen. 
* 在电影兴起时的美国，多数人从降生到死亡都不会离开故乡，电影的流行意味着你只需要花费一小笔钱财就能领略从未见过的广阔世界。不仅是在银幕上观赏都市的景色，人们也在电影中学习时尚，观看女性大胆的表演。随着电影成为社会生活的重要话题之一，制作电影的收益不断蹿升，华尔街资本也开始进入这个新兴行业。随之而来的是从业者收入的上涨，电影被正式地纳入商业世界的版图，男性开始涌入。
* Before G.w.Griffith, film had a tendency to be stagy and airless, He brought the wind in the trees to cinema, a sense of the outside world. Decades later, the critic Roland Barthes said that some images have unplanned, natural details in them that move us. Barthes called this the punctum. The thing that pricks our feelings. Griffith's work is full of the punctum. Griffith worked with Billy Bitzer, an outstanding cinemaphotographer. Bitzer disliked the hard edge of the film image, so put a collar around the lens hood to make the edge of the image go slightly darker. Griffith and Bitzer understood the psychological intensity of a lens. They used visual softness and back lighting, which gave a halo to hair and made actors stand out against backgrounds.
* *Birth of the Nation* is one of the greatest shock in the story of film. They made this deceitful state of the nation movie that raised a racist flag which showed the power of cinema and its danger. There're factors such as drunk and unclean black senators, Wagner music, black soldiers. After some screenings, black audience were attacked with clubs. The 3K had been disbanded in 1869, but by the mid-1920s, its membership back up to 4 million. Inspired by *Cabiria* and the novels of Charles Dickens, He made *Intolerance* about love's struggle through history. The film showed human intolerance in Babylon, in the life of Jesus Christ, tinted in sepia. In the massacre of Saint Batholomew in medieval, violent scenes, tinted in blue. And in modern gangsterism, all shiny cars and jazz outfits. Then inter-cut these. Griffith's cutting in *Intolerance* was saying: these very different events, from different eras, all show the same human trait. This kind of editting can be seen as an intellectual sighpost. 拍摄*Intolerance*时移动摄影机被架设在起吊机和热气球上以获取足够的高度拍摄宏伟的场景，这是影史上的伟大创新，此时离电影诞生也只不过区区20年。
* The pioneer use of parallel editting in Asia made *Souls on the Road* the first great Japanese film.

## Episode 02
* World War I ended in 1918. A few years later, the surrealist manifesto said that art should record dream. Starlets with the especial slenderness of youth were attracted by the bauble which is Hollywood with its escapism and promise of perfection. But before the 1920s were over, key filmmakers were trying to break the bauble.
* 1920年前后重要的商人与制片商：Adolph Zukor & Paramount, Warner bros, Louis B.Mayer & MGM. They built big boring bunkers called "sound stages" for the needs of production by which filming could move indoors to control light. 
* Hollywood set up a production line system while in Japan directors led the process. In Hollywood, the whole point was to standardize and control, it was a "dictatorship in which the artist is silenced".
* Stanley Donen, who made *Singin' in the Rain* thinks that the "studio system" didn't really get into the film, it was a garden where gifted people all worked. The "studio system", a capitalist production line, was copied around the world. Industries made formulaic, copycat movies. They also fostered expertise and taste, extravagance and brilliance.  
* MGM was said to have "more stars than there are in heaven", its movies had an opulence and optimism. Warner was more streetwise, its stars were angels with dirty faces. Paramount's style was feminine, romantic, more taken by the "veiled" and the east.
* Hollywood mainstream films in the 20s were entertaining and romantic. Were they innovative? Some of the most popular films of the 20s, the comedies, most certainly were.
* The greatest American comedy directors: Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd. Before them, there was mostly slapstick, sight gag, good but cheap laugh. 
* Keaton was the greatest comic image-maker the cinema had yet seen. He thought like an architect. Keaton helped define silent cinema. 他的一系列作品显示他已掌握了剪辑的要领，领悟了电影是一场视觉的游戏，同时勇敢地亲自尝试完成特技戏份。Keaton's inventiveness was often highly planned, but sometimes spontaneous. In *The General*, every visual joke and setup in the first half is repeated and amplified in the second, but in reverse order. The climax of *The General* has been called: the most stunning visual event ever arranged. 他使用了桥梁垮塌，火车坠落这一桥段，银幕上的灾难都是来自真实的取景，此后火车损毁在电影中开始流行。Such scale, such sublime was a key element of silent film. At that time, labor was cheap, Wall Street hadn't crashed, imaginations were extarvagant and uncapped. Studios were not yet afraid of the size of directors' dreams. Eventually Keaton's dreams overstripped his box office, and he was sacked by MGM. Keaton filmed in deadpan, and kept back from the action. 即保持表演的冷静与克制，这一点影响了诸多后辈，如巴勒斯坦人 Elia Suleiman.
* Chaplin was less into the camera than Keaton, he was far more into body movement. Chaplin thought like a dancer and a vaudevillian. The film *The Kid* humanized comic cinema, it showed Chaplin's passionate empathy with the poor. Chaplin was cinema's Charles Dickens. The Soviets thought of him as a marxist, but Chaplin was almost a Jungian too. He showed the unconcious lives of his characters. In *The Graet Dictator*, the idea of the dictator kicking the ballon is a great metaphor, because it's Hitler making the world his toy. Chaplin made a buffoon of Hitler but not made him be the orge that he was. He combined fascism and ballet. Chaplin inspired Jacques Tati, Toto, Raj Kapoor, Billy Wilder. Chaplin co-funded United Artists, the studio was one of the great foundation stones of Hollywood. But to the country's shame, it kicked him out in the 50s, because he was a leftist. 
* Actor and producer Norman Lloyd who knew Chaplin and Alfred Hitchcock: Hitch came from a middle class family, his father was a dealer, and Hitch always had an aspiration to be part of that world. Charlie came out of the direst poverty, his mom was put into an asylum, his father was a drinker, he and his half-brother had to steal rotten fruit. Such an upbringing was in his movies.
* The comedian who was most influenced by Chaplin in the 20s was Harold Lloyd. At first Lloyd was too like Chaplin, but then he and his producer tried him in big black-rimmed glasses. In those days this was a nerd look. But add in his athleticism and the flinty courage and you get a ballsy dreamer, both aggresive and lyrical. Japan's great director Yasujiro Ozu was influenced by Lloyd.
* Reality can break fantasy, and in the 20s, several filmmakers already realized this. They wanted to show real life, without the costumes and glitter. In 1921, an Irish-American explorer, Robert Flaherty, made the longest non-fiction film so far, *Nannook of the North*.  It's no travelogue. It stared into Nanook's face. It's about his psychology, his mythic struggle against the elements. Flaherty was a romantic, but by using non-actors, non-stars in this film. He made the audience look more ethically. And so documentary, as an art form, as a viable genre, was born. Documentary is often thought of as merely information, but in fact non-fiction cinema is amongst the most innovative. 
* Eric Von Stroheim's drive to realism was more obsessive than Flaherty's. The story of *Greed* shows Stroheim's contempt for Hollywood romance. The finished movie ran 7h. Stroheim was the Emile Zola or Dostojevski of cinema. Cinematographer Carl: "Early in his life he was visited by such very great humiliation, such deep, inward, psychic wounds that there came in him and an insane desire to use his genius as a weapon." MGM hated the results. Stroheim's ultra-realism became a stigma. He didn't get to direct any more films. *Queen Kelly*, a sublime extravagant real movie from the 1920s, was directed by Eric Von Stroheim. For complicated reasons, the movie never saw the light of day.
* *The Crowd* tried to portray 20s America with far more realism than romantic cinema. It became the greatest pre-Wall street crash social problem picture of its time. Vidor pushed realism in acting beyond the Hollywood norm. He films the leading actress in *The Crowd* in static shot, a longish take, no fancy clothes or set, just her growing despair. *The Crowd* was the 1st movie to use New York extensively as a location with hidden cameras. An overhead studio crane shot finds the actor among other identical desks, showing the scale of the office. 
* MGM was uneasy about *The Crowds*'s refusal to romanticize ordinary New York life. They made Vidor shoot 7 different endings in various shades of optimism. 
* *The Crowd* sums up a lot about cinema of the 20s and 30s. It showed mass society emerging, it focused on the everyman, as French films would do. And it showed the kinetic energy of cities, their rhythms and compositions, like the German movies of Fritz Lang and Walter Ruttmann and Soviet Union films of Dziga Vertov. 
* In the Soviet Union in the 20s, *Aelita: Queen of Mars* played with rebellious idea of realism and cities. In *Posle Smerti*, the director Bauer used an open door to creat a slit on screen, like a Vermeer painting. And a natural main source light in the foreground was daring at that time. In this film, Bauer dissolves from nighttime blue to black and white to show a dream.
* Where romantic cinema was usually optimistic, these early Russian films were laments, pessimistic in a way, about the realism of grief and loss and longing.
* Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer challenged romantic and fantasy cinema with such deeply felt realism that he was almost a one man reformation, undercutting the emotionalism of mainstream cinema with a spiritual spareness. In *The Passion of Joan of Arc*, there's no depth to the image, nothing in the background, no set and shadows. The walls were painted pink to remove their glare so as not to detract from the actress' face. Dreyer had them say the actual words that were spoken at the trial nearly 500 years earlier. He thought that this gave the scene conviction. 
* Dreyer was born out of wedlock, adopted, and brought up a Lutheran. Though he didn't believe in God, the purity and plainness of Lutheran churches seemed to have formed his inner eye. He is the master of pared-down decor. He filmed on misty days or into the light to soften his imagery. His shots became paler, whiter. His huanting vampire movie *Vampyr* features shadows against a white wall. The shadows seem to have life of their own.  
* Carl Theodor Dreyer: In *Ordet* I began a radical simplification. I'd only accept things directly related to the story...You can't simplify reality without understanding it first.
* Dreyer's utterly spare use of whiteness was wildly rebellious. Hollywood romantic cinema was supposed to be decorative, full of detail, not blank. In *Gertrud*, he filmed the girl who believed completely in the power of love if through a white scrim, as if in heaven.
* Dreyer's radical reduction influenced Lars Von Trier in *Dogville*.

## Episode 03
* After the realists, the second challenge to conventional cinema in the 20s came from Ernst Lubitsch. In the film he directed, he mocked the heavy-handed, almost victorian way, that sex and love were shown in the movies, and came up with a style that was all his own. And few directors anywhere in the world were as visually daring as Lubitsch. *The Mountain Cat* is a riot of surreal production design. Its screen masking is even more daring. Such virtuosiy was noticed by Hollywood and that was his last film before moving there. 
* American censorship meant that Lubitsch had to be inventive in how he portrayed sexuality there. In *The Marriage Circle* he uses a break amid breakfast to represent the urge to enjoy sex. Lubitsch films nothing of their lovemaking of course, but his use of objects is a cinematic equivalent of a raised eyebrow, far more daring in his suggestion of sexuality than Chaplin or Keaton or Lloyd.
