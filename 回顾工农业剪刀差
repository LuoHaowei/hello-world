Once we have done this calculation, we can easily test for SARP. 
We just see if there is a situation where there is a star in row t, column s, 
and also a star in row s, column t. 
If so, we have found a situation where observation
t is revealed preferred to observation s, either directly or indirectly, and,
at the same time, observation s is revealed preferred to observation t. This
is a violation of the Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference.
